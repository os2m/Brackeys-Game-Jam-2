## Type
	
	A multiplayer game (single player possible)
	Against time and other players (local area network) 
	For the 2nd Brackeys GameJam
	
# Idea 💡 :

The 2nd Brackeys GameJam was under the theme: "Love is blind".

We have explored this topic in two ways:

First, the man in our game finds his dream wife, although she looks like any other woman (only to be recognized by floating hearts).

On the other hand, the men are blinded by their love and ignore the dangers of traffic.

# Story 📖 :

Like every day, you stand at the bus stop and wait for your bus when you suddenly discover THE ONE on the other side of the road.

You lose completely the overview of what is happening around you and for everything in the world, you want to go to the woman of your dreams which seems to be only one street away.

Totally blind of love, you try to run across the dangerous road to your dream woman.
But watch out, it seems that you are not the only man who cares about her.

You not only have to dodge the cars, but you have to be fast before another man reaching your future wife.

# How to play 🕹 :

## Movement

	- Use your mouse to look around
	- Use WASD to move
	
## Goal
	
	- across the street, but watch out for the fast cars
	- if you play with other poeple than be the first on the other side
